# Michigan Bike Safety Rules: What Every Rider Needs to Know

Cycling in Michigan is a fantastic way to explore our beautiful state, but it's crucial to understand and follow the safety rules and regulations. Whether you're riding a traditional bike or an e-bike, knowing the laws helps keep everyone safe on the road.

## Michigan Bicycle Laws

### Right to the Road
In Michigan, bicycles are considered vehicles and have the same rights and responsibilities as motor vehicles. This means:
- Bicycles can use most roads (except freeways)
- Cyclists must follow all traffic laws
- Motorists must treat cyclists with respect and give them space

### Required Equipment
Michigan law requires bicycles to have:
- **Front light**: White light visible from 500 feet
- **Rear reflector**: Red reflector visible from 100-600 feet
- **Side reflectors**: Amber reflectors on each side
- **Brakes**: Working brakes on both wheels

### Helmet Laws
While Michigan doesn't require helmets for adults, they're strongly recommended for all riders. Children under 18 must wear helmets when riding on public roads.

## E-Bike Specific Regulations

### Classification
Michigan classifies e-bikes into three categories:
- **Class 1**: Pedal-assist only, max speed 20 mph
- **Class 2**: Throttle-assist, max speed 20 mph  
- **Class 3**: Pedal-assist, max speed 28 mph

### Where You Can Ride
- **Class 1 & 2**: Can ride on bike paths and trails
- **Class 3**: May be restricted on some trails
- **All classes**: Can ride on roads and bike lanes

## Essential Safety Practices
