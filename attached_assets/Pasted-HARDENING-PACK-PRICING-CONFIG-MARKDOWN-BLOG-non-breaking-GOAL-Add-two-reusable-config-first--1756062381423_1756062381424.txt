HARDENING PACK — PRICING CONFIG + MARKDOWN BLOG (non-breaking)

GOAL
Add two reusable, config-first features:
1) Centralized pricing config with a Pricing section on Home (pure config, no DB).
2) Markdown blog fallback that works even without a database.
Also fix header DOM nesting warnings, then print a self-audit so we can export to Cursor.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT break existing flows (products/cart/checkout/leads).
- Keep everything working if markdown files are missing or pricing config is empty.
- Keep Postgres + Stripe logic as-is; this task is additive.
- Vite + React app; keep current env usage.

TASKS

A) PRICING CONFIG (pure config, reusable across brands)
1) Create file: client/src/commerce/pricing.config.ts
   - Export interface:
     export interface PricingTier { id: string; label: string; priceMonthly: number; features: string[] }
   - Export object:
     export const PRICING = {
       currency: "USD",
       tiers: [
         { id:"starter", label:"Starter",      priceMonthly:20,  features:["Basic site", "Email support", "1 brand"] },
         { id:"solo",    label:"Solo Hustler", priceMonthly:50,  features:["Pro site", "Priority support", "3 brands"] },
         { id:"dealer",  label:"Dealer Pro",   priceMonthly:200, features:["Advanced e-com", "VIP support", "Unlimited brands"] }
       ],
       note: "7-day free trial available"
     };
2) Create component: client/src/components/PricingSection.tsx
   - Renders from PRICING only (no DB). Shows currency, tiers, features, and note.
   - If PRICING.tiers is empty, render nothing (safe fallback).
3) Add to Home page:
   - Import and render <PricingSection /> near the bottom of client/src/pages/Home.tsx.
4) README updates:
   - Add “Pricing Update Guide” (edit one file: client/src/commerce/pricing.config.ts; no code changes needed).
   - Add a table showing example tiers and how to change currency.

B) MARKDOWN BLOG FALLBACK (DB optional)
1) Content folder:
   - Create directory: client/src/content/posts
   - Add 3 demo markdown files with frontmatter:
     ---
     title: "Choosing Your First Commuter Bike"
     slug: "first-commuter-bike"
     date: "2025-08-01"
     excerpt: "How to pick the perfect daily ride."
     tags: ["commuter","beginner"]
     ---
     (then some markdown content)
   - Add two more similar demo posts.
2) Loader:
   - Create file: client/src/lib/blog.loader.ts
     - Export async function loadMarkdownPosts() that imports all *.md under client/src/content/posts, parses frontmatter (title, slug, date, excerpt, tags), returns sorted list by date desc.
     - If no files found, return empty array (safe).
   - Use a tiny, dependency-light frontmatter parse (no heavy CMS).
3) Blog page behavior (client/src/pages/Blog.tsx):
   - Prefer markdown: try loadMarkdownPosts().
   - If markdown array has posts → render them (title, date, excerpt, “Read more”).
   - If empty → fall back to existing DB posts (current behavior).
   - If both empty → show friendly “No posts yet.”
4) README updates:
   - “Blog via Markdown” section: where to add files, frontmatter format, how to add images (client/public/images/blog/*), and how fallback works.

C) UI/QA FIXES
1) Fix DOM nesting/header warnings:
   - Resolve Link/a nesting issues in Header/Nav to eliminate console warnings.
2) Keep typecheck and lint clean; do not introduce new warnings.

D) SELF-AUDIT (PRINT RESULTS ONLY, DO NOT JUST SAY DONE)
Output the following:
1) File tree for new/modified files:
   - client/src/commerce/pricing.config.ts
   - client/src/components/PricingSection.tsx
   - client/src/content/posts/* (list the 3 demo files)
   - client/src/lib/blog.loader.ts
   - client/src/pages/Blog.tsx (modified)
   - client/src/pages/Home.tsx (modified)
   - README.md (modified)
2) Pricing Check:
   - Detected currency, number of tiers, and first tier label from PRICING.
   - Confirm Home renders <PricingSection /> when tiers exist.
3) Blog Check:
   - Count of markdown posts loaded.
   - Confirm Blog prefers markdown; falls back to DB if none.
4) Warnings:
   - Confirm header DOM nesting warnings are resolved.
5) Non-breaking guarantee:
   - Confirm products/cart/checkout/leads still work.
6) Next steps (PRINT):
   - Exact commands or path to zip/export this project.
   - Short note: “Safe to migrate to Cursor and convert to Next.js”.

Do not remove any existing capabilities. This is a quick additive pack to finalize v0.1.0 before export.
