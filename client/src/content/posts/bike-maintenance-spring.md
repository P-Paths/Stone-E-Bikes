# Essential Spring Bike Maintenance

After a long winter, your bike needs some attention before hitting the road. A little maintenance goes a long way in ensuring a safe and enjoyable riding season.

## Basic Spring Tune-Up Checklist

### 1. Clean Your Bike
Start with a thorough cleaning:
- Use mild soap and water
- Avoid high-pressure hoses near bearings
- Dry completely to prevent rust

### 2. Check Your Tires
- Inspect for cracks, wear, or embedded debris
- Check tire pressure (usually printed on tire sidewall)
- Consider replacing if tread is worn

### 3. Brake Inspection
Safety first! Check your brakes:
- Test brake lever feel and travel
- Inspect brake pads for wear
- Check cable tension and alignment

### 4. Chain and Drivetrain
- Clean and lubricate the chain
- Check for chain wear with a chain checker tool
- Inspect derailleur alignment

### 5. Quick Safety Check
- Ensure all bolts are tight
- Check that wheels spin freely
- Test shifting through all gears

## When to See a Professional

While basic maintenance is DIY-friendly, consider professional service for:
- Brake adjustments
- Derailleur tuning
- Bearing maintenance
- Wheel truing

## Maintenance Schedule

A well-maintained bike is a safe bike. Don't skip the spring tune-up – your bike (and your safety) will thank you!
