# The Electric Bike Revolution

Electric bikes (e-bikes) are revolutionizing urban transportation, making cycling accessible to more people than ever before. Whether you're dealing with hills, longer distances, or just want a little extra help, e-bikes open up new possibilities.

## What Makes E-Bikes Special?

E-bikes provide pedal assistance, meaning:
- The motor only engages when you pedal
- You can adjust the level of assistance
- You still get exercise, just with less effort

### Extended Range
With motor assistance, you can:
- Tackle longer commutes without arriving sweaty
- Conquer hills that might otherwise be challenging
- Carry heavier loads more easily

## Types of E-Bikes

### 1. City/Commuter E-Bikes
